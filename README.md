# DICOM.R

DICOM image data processor in R# language.

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. DICOM is most commonly used for storing and transmitting medical images enabling the integration of medical imaging devices such as scanners, servers, workstations, printers, network hardware, and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) from multiple manufacturers. It has been widely adopted by hospitals and is making inroads into smaller applications such as dentists' and doctors' offices.

### How to use

Get raster raw data from a given NRRD raw data file should be very simple:

```r
require(NRRD);

# open raw NRRD data file 
nrrd   = NRRD::nrrdRead("..\\data\\stent.nrrd");
# view of the file header data
header = as.list(NRRD::metadata(nrrd));
# and get raster data for image rendering
raster = NRRD::getRaster(nrrd);
```

#### Raster image rendering

![](./test/stent/raster__234.png)

```r
require(graphics2D);

# for a 2d image
bitmap(file = "./raster_image_heatmap.png", size = [1024,1024], fill ="black");
# draw heatmap
graphics2D::rasterHeatmap(raster, colorName = "viridis");
dev.off();

# for a specific layer from the 3d scan data
bitmap(file = `./stent/raster__${i}.png`, size = [256,256], fill ="black");
# draw heatmap
graphics2D::rasterHeatmap(
    x = raster â†’ NRRD::getRasterLayer(i), 
    colorName = "viridis:turbo"
);
dev.off();
```
