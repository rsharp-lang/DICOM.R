        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Overview of the header structure
 
 In order to keep compatibility with the analyze format, 
 the size of the nifti header was maintained at 348 bytes
 as in the old format. Some fields were reused, some were 
 preserved, but ignored, and some were entirely 
 overwritten.</p>

   #  The field Short Dim[8] contains the size Of the image array. The first 
   #  element (Dim[0]) contains the number Of dimensions (1-7). If Dim[0] Is 
   #  Not In this interval, the data Is assumed To have opposite endianness And 
   #  so, should be Byte-swapped (the nifti standard does Not specify a 
   #  specific field For endianness, but encourages the use Of Dim[0] For this 
   #  purpose). The dimensions 1, 2 And 3 are assumed To refer To space (x, y, z), 
   #  the 4th dimension Is assumed To refer To time, And the remaining 
   #  dimensions, 5, 6 And 7, can be anything Else. The value Dim[i] Is a

   #  during the acquisition (1, 2 or 3). For spiral sequences, frequency 
   #  and phase encoding are both set as 0. The reason to collapse all
   #  this information in just one byte was to save space. See also

   #  The short intent_code Is an integer that codifies that the data

   #  such as the number of degrees of freedom (df). These extra

   # Magic string.
   #  
   #  The char magic[4] field is a “magic” string that declares 
   #  the file as conforming with the nifti standard. It was 
   #  placed at the very end of the header to avoid overwriting 
   #  fields that are needed for the analyze format. Ideally, 
   #  however, this string should be checked first. It should be 
   #  'ni1' (or '6E 69 31 00' in hexadecimal) for .hdr/.img pair, 
   #  or 'n+1' (or '6E 2B 31 00') for a .nii single file. In the 
   #  absence of this string, the file should be treated as 
   #  analyze. Future versions of the nifti format may increment 
   #  the string to 'n+2', 'n+3', etc. Indeed, as of 2012, a second 
   #  version is under preparation.
