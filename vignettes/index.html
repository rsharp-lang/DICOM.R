Description: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard 
   for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. 
   DICOM is most commonly used for storing and transmitting medical images enabling 
   the integration of medical imaging devices such as scanners, servers, workstations,
   printers, network hardware, and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) 
   from multiple manufacturers. It has been widely adopted by hospitals and is making 
   inroads into smaller applications such as dentists' and doctors' offices.
